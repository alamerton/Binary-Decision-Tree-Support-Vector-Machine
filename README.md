# Support Vector Machine Assignment

## Overview
This repository contains the work for the Support Vector Machine assignment for the Pattern Recognition, Neural Networks and Deep Learning (7CCSMPNN) module.

## Assignment Details

### Dataset
The assignment uses a dataset with three classes, each containing 10 samples. The data points are plotted and analyzed for linear separability.

### Methods
- **Binary Decision Tree:** Used to separate the three classes using two SVMs.
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM):** Implemented to find optimal hyperplanes for class separation.

### Key Components
1. **Data Visualization:** Plot of the dataset demonstrating linear separability.
2. **Binary Decision Tree:** Block diagram showing the structure of the decision tree with two SVMs.
3. **Support Vector Identification:** Analysis of support vectors for each class.
4. **Hyperplane Design:** Calculations and equations for the separating hyperplanes.
5. **Test Dataset:** Application of the SVMs to average values of the original dataset samples.

## Results
- The dataset was found to be linearly separable.
- Two hyperplanes were successfully designed to separate the three classes.
- The test dataset was correctly classified using the designed SVMs.
